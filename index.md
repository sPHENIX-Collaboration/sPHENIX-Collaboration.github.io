Code from the `master` branch is pulled and build each night (nightly-build) 
and it becomes [part of the default software environment on RCF](https://wiki.bnl.gov/sPHENIX/index.php/Setup#.28At_each_login.29_Run_sPHENIX_login_shell). 
Weekly snapshot of the build is also available as ANA-builds. 

Due to its importance, update of this repository require going through a review via [the "Pull Request" process](https://wiki.bnl.gov/sPHENIX/index.php/GitHub_Coresoftware_Update_Procedures). New pull requests will be automatically checked with the [sPHENIX Jenkins continuous integration](https://web.sdcc.bnl.gov/jenkins-sphenix/). At the end of the check, a report will be posted back to the corresponding pull request thread.
